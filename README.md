This is a game i made on Scratch for my CSP class. 
### How it works
Each square has its own variable which changes according to which turn its pressed. 
If it is the 1st, 3rd, 5th,7th or 9th turn, it turns to x, and when its not it turns to o. 
If there is a row with only x or o, the game ends.


### Error and Bugs ⚠️

-X can turn into O if its cell is pressed when the turn belongs to the O player.

-You have to press the green flag multiple times before trying the game to clean up any bugs or errors.
