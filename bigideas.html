1.1 Collaboration:
Computer innovations are new ideas in coding or tech. For example, a new Super Mario Brothers game was improved through collaboration—players gave feedback, and developers updated the game.

1.2 Program Design and Development:
After the first version of a program, developers use feedback from users and testers to fix problems, add features, and make the app better.

1.3 Program Function and Purpose:
The purpose is why the program was made, while the function is what it can do now. For example, WhatsApp’s purpose was safe chatting, but now its functions also include calls, media sharing, and voice messages.

1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors:
The four main errors are logic, syntax, overflow, and runtime. They can be found and fixed using testing, debugging, tracing, or extra print statements.
