    <h2>Collabration</h2>
    <p>This section was not difficult. We easily completed the task without any major errors.</p>
    <h2>XOX Scratch</h2>
    <p>This section was more difficult from the other one. I coded one box and copied it to 8 other boxes. I also coded a variable that checks which turn it belongs to: x or o. If 3 of the same type of character (x or o) ligns up together, they have won the game and the game is finished. There werent any major difficulties just like the first one. </p>
     <h2>XOX Swift</h2>
    <p>This one was the most difficult by far. I was not able to complete it fully. we used VStake and HSTake and some box codes to make grid basically and added X and O adder. But the winner detector was so difficult I believe or I was just not able to understand how to do it and got stuck.</p>
